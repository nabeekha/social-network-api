This code is used to create an API for a web application. This enables users to share thoughts, react to friends' thoughts and create a friend list. The primary techologies used are Express.js, Node.js, MongoDB and Mongoose ODM. I created this application to practice utilizing these technologies in a real-world scenario. Routes are created and tested using Insomnia.
